A 3D Imaging in Cultural Heritage conference was held in the British Museum on the 9th-10th November 2017. 
The conference covered a wide range of methods and applications of 3D imaging, as well as how 3D data can be used both 
for research and to engage with the public. 

The conference was supported by IPERION-CH (Integrated Platform for the European Research Infrastructure on Culture Heritage).
