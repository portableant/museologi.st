In 2017, I was invited by the Digital Humanities scholars of ANU Canberra, to be RHSA visiting scholar to their department. Unfortunately, due to redundancy at the British Museum, I could not take this up. Upon moving to the Fitzwilliam Museum, I managed to go in 2019 for a 4 week stint, which was extremely productive. 

As part of the time spent with Terhi Nurmikko Fuller and Katrina Grant, I worked with the ANU scholars and students to create 3D scans in the Classics museum. This collection of 3D scans was created during time spent in their stores.
