The [Portable Antiquities Scheme website](http://finds.org.uk "The Scheme's website"), which I rebuilt over a period of around 10 months from 2009 &#8211; March 2010 has just won an award at the international &#8216;Museums and the Web' conference held in Philadelphia. I originally entered the Scheme's website just to try and get it a bit more exposure in the international museum sector and it came first in the &#8216;[Research/online collectio](http://conference.archimuse.com/mw2011/best/nominees/research_online_collection "Best of the web category shortlist")n' category against some quite stiff opposition (last year's section was won by the V&A!) Surprisingly for me, it also gathered votes in the people's choice award, which makes me feel very humble. I actually found out that the site had won via Twitter whilst checking in on foursquare to the [Ghazala beach bar](https://foursquare.com/venue/13929982) in Sharm el Sheikh. Power to the web!

The site was created using Zend Framework (started around version 0.7 and now runs on version 1.11.3 &#8211; needs upgrading) and uses Ubuntu, Solr, MySQL and extensive use of YQL to power the various features that you'll find. I'm really pleased that the site was recognised at such a prestigious conference and it is testament to all the people who contribute towards the Scheme's success.
