As any museum researcher will tell you, getting used to a new museum is as much about 
learning about the collections of objects, as chasing down the paper records that 
accompany them. These can yield vital clues about how and where important finds were 
made and how their biography unfolded. Last winter the MicroPasts team (a collaborative, 
multi-disciplinary AHRC-funded project with University College London's Institute of 
Archaeology) assembled at Franks House, to view the British Museum's Bronze Age collection.

Our visit was the inspiration for an exciting new project to digitise one of the first 
catalogues to document British and European prehistory: the Bronze Age 
Index.

The superb Bronze Age objects in the British Museum collection do not tell
the whole story. The history of the Index is filled with periods of inactivity 
punctuated by rapid developments. It began as a major archaeological initiative 
founded by the British Association Committee on Bronze Implements in 1913 
and originally housed at the Society of Antiquaries at Burlington House on Piccadilly. 

It was moved to the Department of British and Medieval Antiquities at the British Museum in 1933, 
though it was sent on loan to the former British Museum curator Professor C F C Hawkes, as acting Chair of European Archaeology 
at Oxford University in 1955. It was finally returned to its permanent 
home at the British Museum in 1966, where it has been kept ever since.

Known as the principal instrument of research in the British Bronze Age', 
the main concept behind the creation of the Index was the idea that by 
compiling a corpus of all Bronze Age metal objects found in the various 
museums and collections across the UK, it would be possible for the first 
time for researchers to study the movements of peoples and trade through 
the exhaustive study of the distributions of certain types of implements 
and weapons used in the period'.

This corpus took the form of an illustrated card catalogue, with each 
index card detailing object findspots and types, alongside detailed line 
drawings and a wide range of further information about the object's 
context of discovery, illustrated below.

For over 70 years, it represented the highest standards of Bronze Age object 
studies.An example of an Index card, a flanged axe found while cutting an 
equestrian figure of King George III, from Osmington Hill, Dorset. 

The Bronze Age Index now contains over 30,000 records of Bronze Age tools 
and weapons largely discovered during the 19th and 20th centuries, and 
complements our current Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) Database of 
metal object finds.

This initiative is interesting not only because it was the first catalogue 
of its kind documenting prehistory on a wide scale, but also because it 
was probably the first British archaeology initiative to call on public 
help with documenting British prehistory way back in the early 20th century.

Investigating a Bronze Age hoard, in this case the Early Bronze Age Arreton Down Hoard from the Isle 
of Wight. Following in the footsteps of creators of the Index, we are once again calling on the public to help us 
research this extremely important untapped resource.

Since late 2013, the digitisation of the entire Index has been undertaken 
by the MicroPasts project. The MicroPasts project employs a crowd-sourcing 
platform (built on the open source project Pybossa) in order to solicit 
help from members of the public or 'citizen archaeologists' to assist us 
transcribing the important information contained on these cards. 

Additionally, people are helping us with creating 3D models of objects, 
many of which are recorded by the Index. By undertaking these transcriptions, 
it will be possible to incorporate the Index's 30,000 records rapidly into the PAS database, 
which on its own includes nearly one million objects collected by the public, 
usually by metal-detectorists.

The result will be the largest national database of prehistoric metal finds 
anywhere in the world and a near-comprehensive view of what we currently 
know about such finds in the UK. Metal finds are not only crucial forms 
of evidence for dating Britain's prehistoric past, but also tell us a 
great deal about prehistoric society and economy. The creation of this 
database will allow for the rethinking of almost everything we currently 
know about the use of metal in Bronze Age Britain, giving us a more 
comprehensive view of our prehistoric past. It is also fascinating as it should demonstrate 
how the interplay between reassessing archaeological archives and the employment 
of new technologies, such as crowd-sourcing, can open up new avenues of research and public engagement.

If you are interested in helping us research and enrich our knowledge of the Bronze Age, as well as 
many other museum archives, please join us and help to realise the 
aspiration of 100 years of Bronze Age study.

The MicroPasts project team is led by Professor Andy Bevan (Institute of Archaeology (IOA),
UCL) and co-investigated by Daniel Pett and Rachael Sparks (IOA, UCL). 

The British Museum Bronze Age Index is managed by Jennifer Wexler in collaboration with Neil Wilkin and 
Chiara Bonacchi (IOA, UCL) and Adi Keinan-Schoonbaert (IOA, UCL) are the principal researchers.

The Project is supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council.
