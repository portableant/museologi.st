Yesterday at the Museum of Classical Archaeology, I led a session to teach members of the public how to create
3D models using Structure from Motion. 20 people attended and I hope enjoyed and learnt new
things. The training materials for the workshop are
on [Github pages](https://universityofcambridgemuseums.github.io/festivalOfIdeas/)
and some of the models are now going online, for example [Greg Painter](https://sketchfab.com/GregPainter)'s below.

I will probably be doing more of these workshops over the next year or so. So if you're interested, look out for
details.
