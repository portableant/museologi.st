Yesterday I went to a workshop organised by Graeme Earl (KCL and soon SOAS) and Catherine Richardson (Kent)
for their AHRC funded [Middling Culture](https://middlingculture.com) project. 

The event was held in a former curry house next to the National Gallery, which has been turned into their 
R&D venue and was a bit more rustic than many imagined :smiley:

The workshop was a chance to discuss the project with the team, and to see the Unreal 
Engine 5 reconstruction of upper-middling status room from the 1620s. This reconstruction was 
built by Grant from [Artas Media](https://artasmedia.com) and demonstrated how far his skills had come on since 
he was first commissioned to create a numismatic reconstruction for the BM money gallery.
