The Museum\nhas gone through a belated period of organisational change, and I left as part of this process. I\nreturned all my equipment, keys and cards, and left the building for the last time having seen just a couple of people; I don't think I will\nset foot in there ever again. A shame as I grew up visiting there with my parents regularly, and it\nwas a primary influence that led to me working in museums and heritage.</p>\n<p>During my time there, I lost my father, we had long periods of family illness to contend with, the pandemic\ndestroyed working practices and I had a team that managed to keep the Museum communicating and working virtually whilst we were all confined\nto our homes.</p>\n<p>I rejoined my college, St Edmund's, as a Senior Member, and I became chairman of Cambridge University Rugby Football Union and joined a\nwide array of committees and steering groups, and I was appointed to the AHRC Peer Review College.</p>\n<p>I managed to bring in Â£1/2 million pounds of research funding as principal or co-investigator, from the AHRC, Leverhulme, British Academy,\nMarlay Research Trust, GCRF, and Cambridge University internal competitive funding pools. The highlights were when I worked with a fabulous group\nof post-doctoral fellows and the research facilitator, and travelling to Egypt twice with my brilliant Antiquities colleagues. I revamped the entire\ndigital presence (single-handed development of the website and collections systems) and finished off all the projects that were on the to do list when I joined.</p>\n<p>They are in a far better place now than they were in 2018 when I joined - network upgraded,\nsystems replaced and upgraded. I've documented my projects and research from my time at the Museum fully on this <a href=\"/projects\">site</a></p>\n<p>I won't miss the 5-hour round trip in my car or the endless meetings that begot yet more meetings to discuss the same thing.</p>\n<p>I never really felt at home in the Fitzwilliam.</p>","id":"09edb146-fc7e-5335-ba53-611677d7f76d","timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":346},"frontmatter":{"slug":"/blog/leaving-fitzwilliam-museum/","date":"September 02,
