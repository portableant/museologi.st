The Museum\nhas gone through a belated period of organisational change, and I left as part of this process. I\nreturned all my equipment, keys and cards, and left the building for the last time having seen just a couple of people; I don't think I will\nset foot in there ever again. A shame as I grew up visiting there with my parents regularly and it\nwas a primary influence that led to me working in museums and heritage.</p>\n<p>During my time there, I lost my father, we had long periods of family illness to contend with, the pandemic\ndestroyed working practices and I had a team that managed to keep the Museum communicating and working virtually whilst we were all confined\nto our homes.</p>\n<p>I rejoined my college, St Edmund's, as a Senior Member, and I became chairman of Cambridge University Rugby Football Union and joined a\nwide array of committees and steering groups, and I was appointed to the AHRC Peer Review College.</p>\n<p>I managed to bring in Â£1/2 million pounds of research funding as principal or co-investigator, from the AHRC, Leverhulme, British Academy,\nMarlay Research Trust, GCRF, and Cambridge University internal competitive funding pools. The highlights were when I worked with a fabulous group\nof post-doctoral fellows and the research facilitator, and travelling to Egypt twice with my brilliant Antiquities colleagues. I revamped the entire\ndigital presence (single handed development of the website and collections systems) and finished off all the projects that were on the to do list when I joined.</p>\n<p>They are in a far better place now than they were in 2018 when I joined - network upgraded,\nsystems replaced and upgraded. I've documented my projects and research from my time at the Museum fully on this <a href=\"/projects\">site</a></p>\n<p>I won't miss the 5 hour round trip in my car or the endless meetings that begot yet more meetings to discuss the same thing.</p>\n<p>I never really felt at home in the Fitzwilliam.</p>","id":"280c6a14-e9ea-506d-8579-3c6235efeccb","timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":348},"frontmatter":{"slug":"/blog/leaving-fitzwilliam-museum","date":"September 02, 2022","title":"Leaving the Fitzwilliam Museum","section":"blog","tags":["museums","job hunting","redundancy","legacy"],"geo_lat":52.200205,"geo_lon":0.119892,"background":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/cad7533406e927b92bb6eb1e4389c91c/b4731/IMG_20190306_142327.jpg","srcSet":"/static/cad7533406e927b92bb6eb1e4389c91c/634ff/IMG_20190306_142327.jpg 300w,\n/static/cad7533406e927b92bb6eb1e4389c91c/44264/IMG_20190306_142327.jpg 600w,\n/static/cad7533406e927b92bb6eb1e4389c91c/b4731/IMG_20190306_142327.jpg 1200w,\n/static/cad7533406e927b92bb6eb1e4389c91c/e749e/IMG_20190306_142327.jpg 2400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/cad7533406e927b92bb6eb1e4389c91c/18655/IMG_20190306_142327.avif 300w,\n/static/cad7533406e927b92bb6eb1e4389c91c/f4bbc/IMG_20190306_142327.avif 600w,\n/static/cad7533406e927b92bb6eb1e4389c91c/5486a/IMG_20190306_142327.avif 1200w,\n/static/cad7533406e927b92bb6eb1e4389c91c/b8ea5/IMG_20190306_142327.avif 2400w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/cad7533406e927b92bb6eb1e4389c91c/d863a/IMG_20190306_142327.webp 300w,\n/static/cad7533406e927b92bb6eb1e4389c91c/3879c/IMG_20190306_142327.webp 600w,\n/static/cad7533406e927b92bb6eb1e4389c91c/0429b/IMG_20190306_142327.webp 1200w,\n/static/cad7533406e927b92bb6eb1e4389c91c/bd01e/IMG_20190306_142327.webp 2400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":600}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/leaving-fitzwilliam-museum","id":"280c6a14-e9ea-506d-8579-3c6235efeccb"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3600676621"]}
