The Museum\nhas gone through a belated period of organisational change, and I left as part of this process. I\nreturned all my equipment, keys and cards, and left the building for the last time having seen just a couple of people; I don't think I will\nset foot in there ever again. A shame as I grew up visiting there with my parents regularly, and it\nwas a primary influence that led to me working in museums and heritage.</p>\n<p>During my time there, I lost my father, we had long periods of family illness to contend with, the pandemic\ndestroyed working practices and I had a team that managed to keep the Museum communicating and working virtually whilst we were all confined\nto our homes.</p>\n<p>I rejoined my college, St Edmund's, as a Senior Member, and I became chairman of Cambridge University Rugby Football Union and joined a\nwide array of committees and steering groups, and I was appointed to the AHRC Peer Review College.</p>\n<p>I managed to bring in Â£1/2 million pounds of research funding as principal or co-investigator, from the AHRC, Leverhulme, British Academy,\nMarlay Research Trust, GCRF, and Cambridge University internal competitive funding pools. The highlights were when I worked with a fabulous group\nof post-doctoral fellows and the research facilitator, and travelling to Egypt twice with my brilliant Antiquities colleagues. I revamped the entire\ndigital presence (single-handed development of the website and collections systems) and finished off all the projects that were on the to do list when I joined.</p>\n<p>They are in a far better place now than they were in 2018 when I joined - network upgraded,\nsystems replaced and upgraded. I've documented my projects and research from my time at the Museum fully on this <a href=\"/projects\">site</a></p>\n<p>I won't miss the 5-hour round trip in my car or the endless meetings that begot yet more meetings to discuss the same thing.</p>\n<p>I never really felt at home in the Fitzwilliam.</p>","id":"09edb146-fc7e-5335-ba53-611677d7f76d","timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":346},"frontmatter":{"slug":"/blog/leaving-fitzwilliam-museum/","date":"September 02, 2022","title":"Leaving the Fitzwilliam Museum","description":"A post about leaving the Fitzwilliam Museum","section":"blog","tags":["museums","job hunting","redundancy","legacy"],"geo_lat":52.200205,"geo_lon":0.119892,"featuredImg":{"id":"54bc4f77-eec3-5a77-b1c4-c17953bc2bb0","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/museologi.st/museologi.st/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot_2022-09-02-17-00-48-27_8a5f4726f7453c77b8d93615cedb556d.jpg","publicURL":"/static/d3aaa7f48f70c457f064c50ef46cf932/Screenshot_2022-09-02-17-00-48-27_8a5f4726f7453c77b8d93615cedb556d.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#384898","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d3aaa7f48f70c457f064c50ef46cf932/279d1/Screenshot_2022-09-02-17-00-48-27_8a5f4726f7453c77b8d93615cedb556d.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d3aaa7f48f70c457f064c50ef46cf932/a793a/Screenshot_2022-09-02-17-00-48-27_8a5f4726f7453c77b8d93615cedb556d.jpg 100w,\n/static/d3aaa7f48f70c457f064c50ef46cf932/e56ef/Screenshot_2022-09-02-17-00-48-27_8a5f4726f7453c77b8d93615cedb556d.jpg 200w,\n/static/d3aaa7f48f70c457f064c50ef46cf932/279d1/Screenshot_2022-09-02-17-00-48-27_8a5f4726f7453c77b8d93615cedb556d.jpg 400w,\n/static/d3aaa7f48f70c457f064c50ef46cf932/a45ee/Screenshot_2022-09-02-17-00-48-27_8a5f4726f7453c77b8d93615cedb556d.jpg 800w","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/d3aaa7f48f70c457f064c50ef46cf932/17f38/Screenshot_2022-09-02-17-00-48-27_8a5f4726f7453c77b8d93615cedb556d.webp 100w,\n/static/d3aaa7f48f70c457f064c50ef46cf932/1070e/Screenshot_2022-09-02-17-00-48-27_8a5f4726f7453c77b8d93615cedb556d.webp 200w,\n/static/d3aaa7f48f70c457f064c50ef46cf932/3398c/Screenshot_2022-09-02-17-00-48-27_8a5f4726f7453c77b8d93615cedb556d.webp 400w,\n/static/d3aaa7f48f70c457f064c50ef46cf932/afc30/Screenshot_2022-09-02-17-00-48-27_8a5f4726f7453c77b8d93615cedb556d.webp 800w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"}]},"width":400,"height":400}}},"background":{"id":"a713d98b-549b-5ed2-8527-3731eb0f7a66","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/museologi.st/museologi.st/content/images/2022/09/IMG_20190306_142327.jpg","publicURL":"/static/6a5a94fc2d59689f1c0b240b77c4c19b/IMG_20190306_142327.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#a88868","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6a5a94fc2d59689f1c0b240b77c4c19b/b4731/IMG_20190306_142327.jpg","srcSet":"/static/6a5a94fc2d59689f1c0b240b77c4c19b/634ff/IMG_20190306_142327.jpg 300w,\n/static/6a5a94fc2d59689f1c0b240b77c4c19b/44264/IMG_20190306_142327.jpg 600w,\n/static/6a5a94fc2d59689f1c0b240b77c4c19b/b4731/IMG_20190306_142327.jpg 1200w,\n/static/6a5a94fc2d59689f1c0b240b77c4c19b/e749e/IMG_20190306_142327.jpg 2400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6a5a94fc2d59689f1c0b240b77c4c19b/d863a/IMG_20190306_142327.webp 300w,\n/static/6a5a94fc2d59689f1c0b240b77c4c19b/3879c/IMG_20190306_142327.webp 600w,\n/static/6a5a94fc2d59689f1c0b240b77c4c19b/0429b/IMG_20190306_142327.webp 1200w,\n/static/6a5a94fc2d59689f1c0b240b77c4c19b/bd01e/IMG_20190306_142327.webp 2400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":600}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/leaving-fitzwilliam-museum/","id":"09edb146-fc7e-5335-ba53-611677d7f76d","breadcrumb":{"location":"/blog/leaving-fitzwilliam-museum/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/blog","crumbLabel":"blog"},{"pathname":"/blog/leaving-fitzwilliam-museum","crumbLabel":"leaving-fitzwilliam-museum"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2240598579","2679611508","3600676621"],"slicesMap":{}}
