By the end of this workshop, you should be equipped to make a scan like <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2JvMl06\">this one.</a></p>\n<p>We will be covering the basics of a technique called photogrammetry. It is non-invasive and requires very little equipment.</p>\n<p>In this process, we use computer software to align multiple overlapping photographs together to reconstruct 3-dimensional measurements. This process is not new and has rapidly risen to become an industry standard.</p>\n<p>In the first part of the workshop you will be given instructions and will see a demonstration of how to create a 3D model. Afterwards, you will be taken into a gallery in the Fitzwilliam Museum and be able to try out the process for yourself.</p>\n<p>For the workshop, you will need to bring:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A device capable of taking digital photos. You can use a compact camera, a DSLR or a mobile phone</li>\n<li>A way of transferring your photos to a computer</li>\n<li>A computer that has at least 8GB of RAM (Apple, PC, or Linux)</li>\n<li>Downloaded <a href=\"http://www.agisoft.com/downloads/installer/\">Agisoft Photoscan Standard</a> and have requested a demo key</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Training material will also be available online to follow the workshop.</p>\n<p>If you would like to attend one of the workshops, but are not able to bring any of the equipment above, please let us know as we may be able to loan you them for the workshop.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These workshops are aiming to embed knowledge about 3D modelling across the University of Cambridge and University of Cambridge Museums. We are particularly interested in reaching early career researchers. 3D modelling is a key skill in material-based arts and humanities research. This will enable researchers to use 3D in their own research. The workshops are part of a wider project, funded by an internal scheme, the industry challenge-led pump-prime fund. The wider project responds to a challenge in the museum sector: deterring visitors from touching objects in the Museum’s collection whilst responding positively to people’s desire to connect and engage with the objects through tactile engagement. The training is one aspect of considering new ways of enabling audiences to engage with collections. Other strands include working with industry leaders ThinkSee3D to create printed 3D models, an interactive gallery installation with AR and 3D modelling in the gallery space and associated research on audience responses to this intervention and two workshops that will enable us to engage with key actors in the heritage sector, including industry, educators, universities, galleries, museums and archives._</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is no cost to attend the workshop. To sign up, please email Helena Rodwell at <a href=\"mailto:hjr41@cam.ac.uk\">hjr41@cam.ac.uk</a> with the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Department</li>\n<li>Job title</li>\n<li>Do you have any access requirements?</li>\n<li>Do you have an eduRoam account?</li>\n<li>Are you happy to be contacted about this project after the workshop?</li>\n<li>Are you able to bring all the required equipment?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there are places available, we will confirm via email. If your preferred workshop is full, we can put you on a waiting list and contact you in case of cancellations.</p>\n<p>If you are not able to make either of the workshops but are interested to learn more, please email us. If there is enough interest, we will arrange an additional workshop.</p>\n<p>Funding for this project has come from the University of Cambridge, Industry Pump Priming grants. </p>","id":"cf454a98-f27d-5950-9666-32cd2d011242","timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":579},"frontmatter":{"slug":"/blog/3-d-modelling-workshops/","date":"November 08, 2018","title":"3-D Modelling Workshops","description":"A post about 3-D Modelling Workshops","section":"blog","tags":["techie stuff","3D"],"geo_lat":52.200205,"geo_lon":0.119892,"featuredImg":{"id":"8bbedbdd-3849-50a5-8b14-e70262f1e7f3","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/museologi.st/museologi.st/content/images/2018/11/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.jpg","publicURL":"/static/b032dbd98819b5663bbe139dc5ae025c/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#383828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b032dbd98819b5663bbe139dc5ae025c/279d1/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b032dbd98819b5663bbe139dc5ae025c/a793a/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.jpg 100w,\n/static/b032dbd98819b5663bbe139dc5ae025c/e56ef/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.jpg 200w,\n/static/b032dbd98819b5663bbe139dc5ae025c/279d1/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.jpg 400w,\n/static/b032dbd98819b5663bbe139dc5ae025c/a45ee/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.jpg 800w","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/b032dbd98819b5663bbe139dc5ae025c/17f38/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.webp 100w,\n/static/b032dbd98819b5663bbe139dc5ae025c/1070e/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.webp 200w,\n/static/b032dbd98819b5663bbe139dc5ae025c/3398c/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.webp 400w,\n/static/b032dbd98819b5663bbe139dc5ae025c/afc30/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.webp 800w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"}]},"width":400,"height":400}}},"background":{"id":"0e38c467-e0ef-523b-997e-e6f135c5db39","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/museologi.st/museologi.st/content/images/backgrounds/scanning.jpg","publicURL":"/static/168ccd8982a37e34016832382a01b64a/scanning.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#483838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/168ccd8982a37e34016832382a01b64a/b4731/scanning.jpg","srcSet":"/static/168ccd8982a37e34016832382a01b64a/634ff/scanning.jpg 300w,\n/static/168ccd8982a37e34016832382a01b64a/44264/scanning.jpg 600w,\n/static/168ccd8982a37e34016832382a01b64a/b4731/scanning.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/168ccd8982a37e34016832382a01b64a/d863a/scanning.webp 300w,\n/static/168ccd8982a37e34016832382a01b64a/3879c/scanning.webp 600w,\n/static/168ccd8982a37e34016832382a01b64a/0429b/scanning.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":600}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/3-d-modelling-workshops/","id":"cf454a98-f27d-5950-9666-32cd2d011242","breadcrumb":{"location":"/blog/3-d-modelling-workshops/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/blog","crumbLabel":"blog"},{"pathname":"/blog/3-d-modelling-workshops","crumbLabel":"3-d-modelling-workshops"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2240598579","2679611508","3600676621"],"slicesMap":{}}
