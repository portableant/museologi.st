The training materials for the workshop are\non <a href=\"https://universityofcambridgemuseums.github.io/festivalOfIdeas/\">Github pages</a>\nand some of the models are now going online, for example <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/GregPainter\">Greg Painter</a>'s below.</p>\n<p>I will probably be doing more of these workshops over the next year or so.
