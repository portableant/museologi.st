These can yield vital clues about how and where important finds were\nmade and how their biography unfolded. Last winter the MicroPasts team (a collaborative,\nmulti-disciplinary AHRC-funded project with University College London's Institute of\nArchaeology) assembled at Franks House, to view the British Museum's Bronze Age collection.</p>\n<p>Our visit was the inspiration for an exciting new project to digitise one of the first\ncatalogues to document British and European prehistory: the Bronze Age\nIndex.</p>\n<p>The superb Bronze Age objects in the British Museum collection do not tell\nthe whole story. The history of the Index is filled with periods of inactivity\npunctuated by rapid developments. It began as a major archaeological initiative\nfounded by the British Association Committee on Bronze Implements in 1913\nand originally housed at the Society of Antiquaries at Burlington House on Piccadilly.</p>\n<p>It was moved to the Department of British and Medieval Antiquities at the British Museum in 1933,\nthough it was sent on loan to the former British Museum curator Professor C F C Hawkes, as acting Chair of European Archaeology\nat Oxford University in 1955. It was finally returned to its permanent\nhome at the British Museum in 1966, where it has been kept ever since.</p>\n<p>Known as the principal instrument of research in the British Bronze Age',\nthe main concept behind the creation of the Index was the idea that by\ncompiling a corpus of all Bronze Age metal objects found in the various\nmuseums and collections across the UK, it would be possible for the first\ntime for researchers to study the movements of peoples and trade through\nthe exhaustive study of the distributions of certain types of implements\nand weapons used in the period'.</p>\n<p>This corpus took the form of an illustrated card catalogue, with each\nindex card detailing object findspots and types, alongside detailed line\ndrawings and a wide range of further information about the object's\ncontext of discovery, illustrated below.</p>\n<p>For over 70 years, it represented the highest standards of Bronze Age object\nstudies.An example of an Index card, a flanged axe found while cutting an\nequestrian figure of King George III, from Osmington Hill, Dorset.</p>\n<p>The Bronze Age Index now contains over 30,000 records of Bronze Age tools\nand weapons largely discovered during the 19th and 20th centuries, and\ncomplements our current Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) Database of\nmetal object finds.</p>\n<p>This initiative is interesting not only because it was the first catalogue\nof its kind documenting prehistory on a wide scale, but also because it\nwas probably the first British archaeology initiative to call on public\nhelp with documenting British prehistory way back in the early 20th century.</p>\n<p>Investigating a Bronze Age hoard, in this case the Early Bronze Age Arreton Down Hoard from the Isle\nof Wight. Following in the footsteps of creators of the Index, we are once again calling on the public to help us\nresearch this extremely important untapped resource.</p>\n<p>Since late 2013, the digitisation of the entire Index has been undertaken\nby the MicroPasts project. The MicroPasts project employs a crowd-sourcing\nplatform (built on the open source project Pybossa) in order to solicit\nhelp from members of the public or 'citizen archaeologists' to assist us\ntranscribing the important information contained on these cards.</p>\n<p>Additionally, people are helping us with creating 3D models of objects,\nmany of which are recorded by the Index. By undertaking these transcriptions,\nit will be possible to incorporate the Index's 30,000 records rapidly into the PAS database,\nwhich on its own includes nearly one million objects collected by the public,\nusually by metal-detectorists.</p>\n<p>The result will be the largest national database of prehistoric metal finds\nanywhere in the world and a near-comprehensive view of what we currently\nknow about such finds in the UK. Metal finds are not only crucial forms\nof evidence for dating Britain's prehistoric past, but also tell us a\ngreat deal about prehistoric society and economy. The creation of this\ndatabase will allow for the rethinking of almost everything we currently\nknow about the use of metal in Bronze Age Britain, giving us a more\ncomprehensive view of our prehistoric past. It is also fascinating as it should demonstrate\nhow the interplay between reassessing archaeological archives and the employment\nof new technologies, such as crowd-sourcing, can open up new avenues of research and public engagement.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in helping us research and enrich our knowledge of the Bronze Age, as well as\nmany other museum archives, please join us and help to realise the\naspiration of 100 years of Bronze Age study.</p>\n<p>The MicroPasts project team is led by Professor Andy Bevan (Institute of Archaeology (IOA),\nUCL) and co-investigated by Daniel Pett and Rachael Sparks (IOA, UCL).</p>\n<p>The British Museum Bronze Age Index is managed by Jennifer Wexler in collaboration with Neil Wilkin and\nChiara Bonacchi (IOA, UCL) and Adi Keinan-Schoonbaert (IOA, UCL) are the principal researchers.</p>\n<p>The Project is supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council.</p>","id":"94a74feb-5147-5403-b5e6-59aee0c143fe","timeToRead":4,"wordCount":{"words":886},"frontmatter":{"slug":"/blog/things-that-go-bump-in-the-night-the-blackmoor-hoard/","date":"November 03, 2014","title":"Things that go bump in the night: the Blackmoor hoard","section":"blog","tags":null,"geo_lat":null,"geo_lon":null,"background":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAMCAgMCAgMDAwMEAwMEBQgFBQQEBQoHBwYIDAoMDAsKCwsNDhIQDQ4RDgsLEBYQERMUFRUVDA8XGBYUGBIUFRT/2wBDAQMEBAUEBQkFBQkUDQsNFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBT/wgARCAAKABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUEBgf/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACA//aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB0kt0GSXjEqf/xAAaEAEBAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAwEEBRIT/9oACAEBAAEFAuevQ6T0nEQPaEwVnVmfR4wV/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAwEBPwE//8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIRAR/9oACAECAQE/AcWf/8QAIRAAAQMDBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQADEQISIQQTFFEjMkH/2gAIAQEABj8C4+mkO1mLulpy6A6Q3aN9w4+zhN+Tdx79qkkAlPG0SMDCgCAv/8QAHBABAAIDAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFBcVHw/9oACAEBAAE/IViDmbK7ffxGVjWkgvj3Xuty9VxiO+wEY0pdQJBSzg+RwIMAFBP/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEFjv/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREQ/9oACAEDAQE/EBgTP//EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAETH/2gAIAQIBAT8QUvWxy//EABoQAQEBAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAERIQAxQVH/2gAIAQEAAT8QdkJqmWE2AqGIP1z7cH20aRmMIAAuxtEjgGKOmibubvVM7LWPi+cKkZBX9D8GGeZ2aRzA/APO/9k="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9b51f2685bb8facf03d74537f4cb44bd/d19b8/MBA-hoard.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9b51f2685bb8facf03d74537f4cb44bd/c7968/MBA-hoard.jpg 250w,\n/static/9b51f2685bb8facf03d74537f4cb44bd/2f5cc/MBA-hoard.jpg 500w,\n/static/9b51f2685bb8facf03d74537f4cb44bd/d19b8/MBA-hoard.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/9b51f2685bb8facf03d74537f4cb44bd/db97f/MBA-hoard.avif 250w,\n/static/9b51f2685bb8facf03d74537f4cb44bd/e07fa/MBA-hoard.avif 500w,\n/static/9b51f2685bb8facf03d74537f4cb44bd/ee7de/MBA-hoard.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/9b51f2685bb8facf03d74537f4cb44bd/e396a/MBA-hoard.webp 250w,\n/static/9b51f2685bb8facf03d74537f4cb44bd/e6433/MBA-hoard.webp 500w,\n/static/9b51f2685bb8facf03d74537f4cb44bd/a9911/MBA-hoard.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":600}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/things-that-go-bump-in-the-night-the-blackmoor-hoard/","id":"94a74feb-5147-5403-b5e6-59aee0c143fe"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3600676621"]}
