I originally entered the Scheme's website just to try and get it a bit more exposure in the international museum sector and it came first in the ‘<a href=\"http://conference.archimuse.com/mw2011/best/nominees/research_online_collection\" title=\"Best of the web category shortlist\">Research/online collectio</a>n' category against some quite stiff opposition (last year's section was won by the V&#x26;A!) Surprisingly for me, it also gathered votes in the people's choice award, which makes me feel very humble. I actually found out that the site had won via Twitter whilst checking in on foursquare to the <a href=\"https://foursquare.com/venue/13929982\">Ghazala beach bar</a> in Sharm el Sheikh. Power to the web!</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/mw2011?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#mw2011</a> Best of the Web Awards: Research / Online Collection goes to Portable Antiquities Scheme http://finds.org.uk Congratulations!</p>&mdash; MuseWeb (@museweb) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/museweb/status/56469218559926272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 8, 2011</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Other entrants included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen</li>\n<li>New York Botanical Gardens</li>\n<li>J.
