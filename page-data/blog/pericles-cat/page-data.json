Today we lost Pericles, our beloved cat. A creature who had been in our lives\nsince March 2008, a rescue cat from Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. Originally called Tommy Boy, we renamed\nhim Pericles, and he joined our family in Trott Street, Battersea (for the first week he hid under a dresser) where he lived until we moved to the countryside in\n2016 whereupon he discovered the wide expanse of Hertfordshire gardens.</p>\n<p>He was a beautiful cat, with a curate's egg of a personality. He was a cat who loved to be stroked, but only on his terms; he could be aloof, he could be\naffectionate, he could be a pain and get under your feet at inopportune times.</p>\n<p>He would defend his territory with a ferocity that would make a lion jealous, but he was also a cat who would\nsit on your lap and purr for hours. He was a small tabby, never weighing more than 3.75kg, but he would take on foxes, badgers\nand tell our massive hound Oskar who was the boss of our house when he arrived to join us from Bulgaria.</p>\n<p>Pericles became a part of our family, he became our son's favourite animal, and he was a constant companion to us all. Without him\nour home has lost a part of its soul.</p>\n<p>May the ferryman take you across the river Styx, Pericles. For endless days of sun and warmth in which you can bask in glory.</p>\n<p>I will miss you my friend.</p>","id":"4d6cecd1-587a-5d0a-b6ee-3047a6347242","timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":256},"frontmatter":{"slug":"/blog/pericles-cat/","date":"September 30, 2022","title":"Our beloved Pericles cat","description":"A post about our mighty Pericles cat","section":"blog","tags":["pericles","cat","grief"],"geo_lat":null,"geo_lon":null,"featuredImg":{"id":"10bbab82-99e4-5950-9c77-0d4bd21b70e3","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/museologi.st/museologi.st/content/images/2022/09/IMG_20191225_094128.jpg","publicURL":"/static/2007c141ba1969ea4b6e5c9fb35613aa/IMG_20191225_094128.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2007c141ba1969ea4b6e5c9fb35613aa/279d1/IMG_20191225_094128.jpg","srcSet":"/static/2007c141ba1969ea4b6e5c9fb35613aa/a793a/IMG_20191225_094128.jpg 100w,\n/static/2007c141ba1969ea4b6e5c9fb35613aa/e56ef/IMG_20191225_094128.jpg 200w,\n/static/2007c141ba1969ea4b6e5c9fb35613aa/279d1/IMG_20191225_094128.jpg 400w,\n/static/2007c141ba1969ea4b6e5c9fb35613aa/a45ee/IMG_20191225_094128.jpg 800w","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/2007c141ba1969ea4b6e5c9fb35613aa/17f38/IMG_20191225_094128.webp 100w,\n/static/2007c141ba1969ea4b6e5c9fb35613aa/1070e/IMG_20191225_094128.webp 200w,\n/static/2007c141ba1969ea4b6e5c9fb35613aa/3398c/IMG_20191225_094128.webp 400w,\n/static/2007c141ba1969ea4b6e5c9fb35613aa/afc30/IMG_20191225_094128.webp 800w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"}]},"width":400,"height":400}}},"background":{"id":"05f4eef4-d930-51ff-993b-5c46618f1362","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/museologi.st/museologi.st/content/images/2022/09/IMG_0088.jpg","publicURL":"/static/7fa544350256e751fdca3161baa8b0c1/IMG_0088.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8d8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7fa544350256e751fdca3161baa8b0c1/b4731/IMG_0088.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7fa544350256e751fdca3161baa8b0c1/634ff/IMG_0088.jpg 300w,\n/static/7fa544350256e751fdca3161baa8b0c1/44264/IMG_0088.jpg 600w,\n/static/7fa544350256e751fdca3161baa8b0c1/b4731/IMG_0088.jpg 1200w,\n/static/7fa544350256e751fdca3161baa8b0c1/e749e/IMG_0088.jpg 2400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/7fa544350256e751fdca3161baa8b0c1/d863a/IMG_0088.webp 300w,\n/static/7fa544350256e751fdca3161baa8b0c1/3879c/IMG_0088.webp 600w,\n/static/7fa544350256e751fdca3161baa8b0c1/0429b/IMG_0088.webp 1200w,\n/static/7fa544350256e751fdca3161baa8b0c1/bd01e/IMG_0088.webp 2400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":600}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/pericles-cat/","id":"4d6cecd1-587a-5d0a-b6ee-3047a6347242","breadcrumb":{"location":"/blog/pericles-cat/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/blog","crumbLabel":"blog"},{"pathname":"/blog/pericles-cat","crumbLabel":"pericles-cat"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2240598579","2679611508","3600676621"],"slicesMap":{}}
