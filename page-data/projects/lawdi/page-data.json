These programmes were a seminal meeting point for the development of Linked Open\nData in classical archaeology and museology and its impact has been huge. For me, and my career, this Institute has influenced\nnearly everything I've created since 2012, and it made me new friends that I have stayed in touch with, stayed with and lived great experiences\nwith.</p>\n<p>The first LAWDI event was hosted by the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University,\nthe second took place at Drew University.</p>\n<h2>2012 - ISAW</h2>\n<p>The first LAWDI event was hosted by the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University, in June 2012\nwith most of the participants staying at a small hotel and walking through Central Park daily to ISAW HQ for the daily\nworkshops. The collaboratively learning environment was a great way to get to know each other and the programme was varied,\ninspiring and challenging. Evenings were spent in conversations in Dive Bars, at dinner and elsewhere creating new\npartnerships, ideas and friendships. DIVEBAR for life.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.39999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block; transition: opacity 0.5s 0.5s; pointer-events: none;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"ISAW plaque\"\n        title=\"ISAW plaque\"\n        src=\"/static/01cd212d00926afc25fae9f0b3aced7d/dbdff/7337644892_b497a8c653_b.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/01cd212d00926afc25fae9f0b3aced7d/0988f/7337644892_b497a8c653_b.jpg 250w,\n/static/01cd212d00926afc25fae9f0b3aced7d/d1f95/7337644892_b497a8c653_b.jpg 500w,\n/static/01cd212d00926afc25fae9f0b3aced7d/dbdff/7337644892_b497a8c653_b.jpg 1000w,\n/static/01cd212d00926afc25fae9f0b3aced7d/87945/7337644892_b497a8c653_b.jpg 1024w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;opacity:0;transition:opacity 0.5s;color:inherit;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px #fff;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/finds/albums/72157630049540234\">Full photoset</a></p>\n<h2>2013 - Drew University</h2>\n<p>The second LAWDI event took place at Drew University in Madison, New Jersey in June 2013.

Old hands and new mixed, the evenings in the communal dwelling\n(and the DRY county ethos) made the event very different to the first.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 12,
