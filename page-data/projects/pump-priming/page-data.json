This is a current international museum challenge and the subject of a Fitzwilliam pilot project.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The Workshops</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Workshop 1: use of 3D for object-based learning and reducing incidents of touching in Museums. Speakers and audience will cover industry, educators, universities, galleries, museums and archives.</li>\n<li>Workshop 2: training and upskilling UCM and University staff (including ECRs) on 3D modelling.</li>\n<li>Workshop 3: impact of using 3D for object-based learning on collections care, how visitors interact with contributions leading to development of large-scale projects as a result of sharing and discussing findings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Web resource</h2>\n<p>This short site was built for the 3D model making workshops organised by Daniel Pett and Jo Vine\nat the Museum of Classical Archaeology and the Fitzwilliam Museum. The workshops were designed to\nfurnish members of the public and academics with knowledge of photogrammetry and 3D modelling software and were\nwell attended and received by the participants.</p>","id":"ef06be06-f14f-520a-ade2-c0445edd82d0","timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":274},"frontmatter":{"date":"November 29, 2018","section":"projects","title":"Pump Priming - the road to learning 3D modeling skills","description":"A series of workshops to teach 3D modeling skills to the British Museum's Digital Humanities team","role":null,"partners":null,"collaborators":["Jo Vine"],"institution":"The Fitzwilliam Museum","publications":null,"geo_lat":52.199722,"geo_lon":0.119167,"news":null,"background":{"id":"8bbedbdd-3849-50a5-8b14-e70262f1e7f3","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/museologi.st/museologi.st/content/images/2018/11/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.jpg","publicURL":"/static/b032dbd98819b5663bbe139dc5ae025c/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#383828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b032dbd98819b5663bbe139dc5ae025c/b4731/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b032dbd98819b5663bbe139dc5ae025c/634ff/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.jpg 300w,\n/static/b032dbd98819b5663bbe139dc5ae025c/44264/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.jpg 600w,\n/static/b032dbd98819b5663bbe139dc5ae025c/b4731/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/b032dbd98819b5663bbe139dc5ae025c/d863a/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.webp 300w,\n/static/b032dbd98819b5663bbe139dc5ae025c/3879c/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.webp 600w,\n/static/b032dbd98819b5663bbe139dc5ae025c/0429b/IMG_20181129_154927-PANO.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":600}}},"project_website":"https://github.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/pump-priming/","slug":"/projects/pump-priming/","vimeo":null,"zenodo_doi":"10.5281/zenodo.6471455","github_repo":[{"url":"https://github.com/FitzwilliamMuseum/pump-priming","name":"Pump priming source code"}],"type":null,"grant_number":null,"grant_amount":null,"funders":["The University of Cambridge"],"tags":["photogrammetry","museums","citizen science","co-curation","3D modeling","workshops"],"deposited_archive":null,"documents":[{"title":"Pump Priming - the road to learning 3D modeling skills - Application","type":"pdf","location":"/pdf/pumpPrimingApplication.pdf"},{"title":"Pump Priming - the road to learning 3D modeling skills - Application","type":"pdf","location":"/pdf/pumpPrimingFinalReport.pdf"}],"audio":null,"featuredImg":{"id":"30bf7e30-8b46-5eed-b756-c649f16c2f73","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/museologi.st/museologi.st/content/images/2018/11/IMG_20181129_143832.jpg","publicURL":"/static/6fece4a56ccdce196a9cfa78c1c49518/IMG_20181129_143832.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#e8d8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6fece4a56ccdce196a9cfa78c1c49518/279d1/IMG_20181129_143832.jpg","srcSet":"/static/6fece4a56ccdce196a9cfa78c1c49518/a793a/IMG_20181129_143832.jpg 100w,\n/static/6fece4a56ccdce196a9cfa78c1c49518/e56ef/IMG_20181129_143832.jpg 200w,\n/static/6fece4a56ccdce196a9cfa78c1c49518/279d1/IMG_20181129_143832.jpg 400w,\n/static/6fece4a56ccdce196a9cfa78c1c49518/a45ee/IMG_20181129_143832.jpg 800w","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6fece4a56ccdce196a9cfa78c1c49518/17f38/IMG_20181129_143832.webp 100w,\n/static/6fece4a56ccdce196a9cfa78c1c49518/1070e/IMG_20181129_143832.webp 200w,\n/static/6fece4a56ccdce196a9cfa78c1c49518/3398c/IMG_20181129_143832.webp 400w,\n/static/6fece4a56ccdce196a9cfa78c1c49518/afc30/IMG_20181129_143832.webp 800w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"}]},"width":400,"height":400}}},"images":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/projects/pump-priming/","id":"ef06be06-f14f-520a-ade2-c0445edd82d0","breadcrumb":{"location":"/projects/pump-priming/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/projects","crumbLabel":"projects"},{"pathname":"/projects/pump-priming","crumbLabel":"pump-priming"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2240598579","2679611508","3600676621"],"slicesMap":{}}
