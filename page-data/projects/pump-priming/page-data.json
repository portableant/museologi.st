This is a current international museum challenge and the subject of a Fitzwilliam pilot project.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The Workshops</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Workshop 1: use of 3D for object-based learning and reducing incidents of touching in Museums. Speakers and audience will cover industry, educators, universities, galleries, museums and archives.</li>\n<li>Workshop 2: training and upskilling UCM and University staff (including ECRs) on 3D modelling.</li>\n<li>Workshop 3: impact of using 3D for object-based learning on collections care, how visitors interact with contributions leading to development of large-scale projects as a result of sharing and discussing findings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Web resource</h2>\n<p>This short site was built for the 3D model making workshops organised by Daniel Pett and Jo Vine\nat the Museum of Classical Archaeology and the Fitzwilliam Museum. The workshops were designed to\nfurnish members of the public and academics with knowledge of photogrammetry and 3D modelling software and were\nwell attended and received by the participants.</p>","id":"ef06be06-f14f-520a-ade2-c0445edd82d0","timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":274},"frontmatter":{"date":"November 29, 2018","section":"projects","title":"Pump Priming - the road
