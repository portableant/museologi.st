The Museum had an aging and insecure networking arrangement, with creaking hardware that broke down\nregularly, a Wi-Fi that ran on the same VLAN,  and a firewall that was just an ACL on the switch connecting the Fitz to CUDN. An outlying object\nstore had been re-cabled, but not connected to anything, and a state of inertia had been reached.</p>\n<p>Various surveys had been conducted for upgrade, progress had been made to get the wheels turning, but no impetus was\nforthcoming. We had to get this moving, so a series of meetings with Cambridge's University Information Services started\nto get the process underway. Agreement in principle was secured to move the Museum's networking\ninfrastructure onto University managed architecture (large capital expenditure to get started - putting in new cables etc., reasonable\noperating expenditure leasing and maintaining equipment). Funding was secured from Fitzwilliam Museum Development Trust and the\nprocess began. Then the pandemic hit, and the project slowed as the University had to focus on response and availability of hardware\nwas low. The Museum's point of presence switch failed early in the pandemic, and UIS replaced this rapidly for us - which provided the\nstimulus to plough ahead. Cabling and firewall followed and by August 2022 (4 years after joining and just as I was about to leave)\nthe project was almost complete.</p>","id":"79dda6a4-88dc-59ed-a21c-721e979600ca","timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":240},"frontmatter":{"date":"October 29, 2019","section":"projects","title":"Fitzwilliam Museum networking upgrade","description":"A project to upgrade the Fitzwilliam Museum's network infrastructure","role":"Museum project leader","featuredImg":{"id":"709716b6-edfb-5b41-a0c6-530b63cf06e1","absolutePath":"/Users/danielpett/3D/GitHub/museologi.st/content/images/fitzGBN.jpg","publicURL":"/static/9d2c78f4ff7bd1ebb7919adcfa63b03a/fitzGBN.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9d2c78f4ff7bd1ebb7919adcfa63b03a/04add/fitzGBN.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9d2c78f4ff7bd1ebb7919adcfa63b03a/e07d1/fitzGBN.jpg 150w,\n/static/9d2c78f4ff7bd1ebb7919adcfa63b03a/05177/fitzGBN.jpg 300w,\n/static/9d2c78f4ff7bd1ebb7919adcfa63b03a/04add/fitzGBN.jpg 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/9d2c78f4ff7bd1ebb7919adcfa63b03a/628fd/fitzGBN.webp 150w,\n/static/9d2c78f4ff7bd1ebb7919adcfa63b03a/8aaca/fitzGBN.webp 300w,\n/static/9d2c78f4ff7bd1ebb7919adcfa63b03a/ec39e/fitzGBN.webp 600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":600}}},"featuredImgAlt":null,"partners":null,"collaborators":["Michael Warren","Rob Howard","Steve Handley"],"institution":"The Fitzwilliam Museum","publications":null,"geo_lat":null,"geo_lon":null,"news":null,"background":{"id":"f76a1ad3-b135-59d5-b035-959be258c119","absolutePath":"/Users/danielpett/3D/GitHub/museologi.st/content/images/gbn.jpg","publicURL":"/static/c55b4f498bc309f3035beefe804c653f/gbn.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c55b4f498bc309f3035beefe804c653f/8551d/gbn.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c55b4f498bc309f3035beefe804c653f/487e9/gbn.jpg 300w,\n/static/c55b4f498bc309f3035beefe804c653f/1d415/gbn.jpg 600w,\n/static/c55b4f498bc309f3035beefe804c653f/8551d/gbn.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/c55b4f498bc309f3035beefe804c653f/21fec/gbn.webp 300w,\n/static/c55b4f498bc309f3035beefe804c653f/72e79/gbn.webp 600w,\n/static/c55b4f498bc309f3035beefe804c653f/0b76f/gbn.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":600}}},"project_website":null,"slug":"/projects/network-upgrade-against-inertia","vimeo":null,"zenodo_doi":null,"github_repo":null,"type":null,"grant_number":null,"grant_amount":null,"funder":null,"funders":null,"tags":["networks","museums","cisco","information services","gigabit","cudn","gbn"],"deposited_archive":null,"documents":null,"audio":null,"images":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/projects/network-upgrade-against-inertia","id":"79dda6a4-88dc-59ed-a21c-721e979600ca"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3600676621","4037206124"]}
