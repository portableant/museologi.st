There were several elements I helped with on this project:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Africa’s rock art is as diverse as the continent itself. The African rock art image project team has catalogued c. 23,000 digital photographs of rock art from across Africa – originally from the Trust for African Rock Art (TARA) – through generous support from the Arcadia Fund.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Rock Art website</h2>\n<p>The original website was a rapid prototype built in  2015 using a single-page JavaScript application (AngularJS),\nwhich made multiple high bandwidth, real time requests to Contentful, bringing back a heavyweight JSON object (2-3MB in\nsize before caching).</p>\n<p>The site was created using the Yeoman framework, which enabled a website to be developed within a tight\ntime-frame but the resulting HTML pages were not search engine friendly, as all content is created client side. AngularJS\nwas employed for the Rock Art website as part of the testing for the technology to be used more widely in the rebuilding\nof the British Museum’s main website (which ultimately did not happen.)</p>\n<p>For the final production version of the website, the team proposed taking the website off the CMS/Contentful to reduce\nload times and page size, creating a series of connected static pages representing the final content of the project.\nA static snapshot of the web’s content was extracted from Contentful, where the Rock Art Project content was originally\nstored, and edited/stored on <a href=\"https://github.com/kingsdigitallab/african-rock-art\">GitHub</a> to generate a static Jekyll site.</p>\n<p>The Jekyll-based static site is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) server (t2 medium instance)\nwhich will eventually become part of the BM Microsoft Azure cloud solution currently being set-up.</p>\n<p>Recap of key features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> - a static site generator</li>\n<li>Contentful - a headless CMS that had been used for building the <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/\">British Museum's website</a> which never came to be.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a> - a static site hosting service</li>\n<li>AWS for final delivery with 3 years of reserved instance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Jekyll site pulled data from Contentful into nodes and created static pages for each rock art image and topic; this created\na sustainable and preservable digital resource - low bandwidth, fast and easy to maintain.</p>\n<h2>3d Models</h2>\n<p>With Jennifer and Steve Dey at ThinkSee3D, we generated 3D models from archive images using photogrammetry methodologies, which\nwere hosted on SketchFab under the British Museum profile, this enabled the physical objects that were still in situ to be\nvisualised. These models were then embedded into the website and some were printed, in digital and\nin lightweight handling materials for use in workshops and events.</p>\n<div class=\"ratio ratio-16x9 my-3\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://sketchfab.com/playlists/embed?collection=3348c986a05d423d850f66ac5500b65a&autostart=0\"\n            title=\"African Rock Art\"\n            allowfullscreen\n            mozallowfullscreen=\"true\"\n            webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"\n            allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; xr-spatial-tracking\"\n            xr-spatial-tracking\n            execution-while-out-of-viewport\n            execution-while-not-rendered\n            web-share\n        ></iframe>\n</div>\n<h2>Rock Art VR</h2>\n<p>In conjunction with Soluis Heritage (who created the BM Bronze Age roundhouse experience), the African Conservation Trust, a VR/XR product\nwas created to enable a <a href=\"https://africanrockart.britishmuseum.org/vr/\">virtual visit</a> to a rock art site (Game Pass Shelter, South Africa) using Google Cardboard. This famous site\nis located within the foothills of the Drakensberg mountains (a rich Rock Art area) on a sandstone recess found at the top of a steep slope. This recess\nholds  paintings made by people from the San|Bushman who lived (and are still present) as hunter-gatherers and fishers throughout southern Africa.</p>\n<p>The product was launched in November 2016 in the BM Great Court, receiving circa 150 visitors who tried the app on one of 6 dedicated Google\nCardboard headsets. Visitor flow was constricted by the available devices; these products take time to use so a simple figure is achieved:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>30 visitors per hour at 5 minutes per experience over the course of the total event running for 5 hours.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Green Sahara</h2>\n<p>The Rock Art collection holds a large amount of Saharan rock art providing one of the best pictorial records of hominids\nand fauna found in the Sahara. Earth and life science research has shown that the Sahara has undergone major climatic changes\nover the last 12-10,000 years.</p>\n<p>Shifts in the Earth’s tilt and orbital rotation changed regional climatic patterns, shifting the monsoon rains in Africa\nfurther north, with the increased water bringing the fertile soil to life and greening the desert (the Green Sahara period).</p>\n<p>For this project, we combined rock art data, 3D models and landscape photos from our archive with satellite imagery to\ncreate an interactive film entitled Rock Art in the Green Sahara.</p>\n<div class=\"ratio-16x9 ratio my-3\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HD_Ot2GaCXo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>This was developed in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://www.greensahara-leverhulme.com/\">Peopling the Green Sahara Project</a>\nat King's College London and the University of Bristol, and incorporates satellite visualisations of climate change in\nthe Sahara over the last 11,000 years with information about the rock art sites.</p>","id":"a7c70138-3789-53dd-9551-af992c1e54d5","timeToRead":3,"wordCount":{"words":765},"frontmatter":{"date":"October 29, 2019","section":"projects","title":"African Rock Art - digital archive","description":"The African Rock Art project, funded by Arcadia, aims to create a digital archive of rock art in Africa, and to make this available to the public.","role":"Museum tech consultancy","featuredImg":{"id":"899761b7-55a8-5d1b-a689-f4d824139681","absolutePath":"/Users/danielpett/3D/GitHub/museologi.st/content/images/2018/rockart.jpg","publicURL":"/static/af93409a3f35f1a7243fba77eb41947f/rockart.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/af93409a3f35f1a7243fba77eb41947f/04add/rockart.jpg","srcSet":"/static/af93409a3f35f1a7243fba77eb41947f/e07d1/rockart.jpg 150w,\n/static/af93409a3f35f1a7243fba77eb41947f/05177/rockart.jpg 300w,\n/static/af93409a3f35f1a7243fba77eb41947f/04add/rockart.jpg 600w,\n/static/af93409a3f35f1a7243fba77eb41947f/3d747/rockart.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/af93409a3f35f1a7243fba77eb41947f/628fd/rockart.webp 150w,\n/static/af93409a3f35f1a7243fba77eb41947f/8aaca/rockart.webp 300w,\n/static/af93409a3f35f1a7243fba77eb41947f/ec39e/rockart.webp 600w,\n/static/af93409a3f35f1a7243fba77eb41947f/49a25/rockart.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":600}}},"featuredImgAlt":null,"partners":null,"collaborators":["Lisa Galvin (British Museum)","Jennifer Wexler (British Museum)","Miguel Vieira (King's Digital Lab)","Ginestra Ferraro (King's Digital Lab)","Helen Anderson","Jorges De Torres","Neil Jakeman (King's Digital Lab)","Steve Dey (ThinkSee3D)","Steve Colmer (Soluis Heritage)"],"institution":"The British Museum","publications":["Elizabeth Galvin and Jennifer Wexler (2022) Hacking the Collections: Digital Objects and Museum Engagement in Watrall, E. & Goldstein, L.
