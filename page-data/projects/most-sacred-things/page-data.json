It was\nfunded by the British Academy/Leverhulme Trust Small Research Grant Scheme, and the Cambridge Humanities Research Grants.</p>\n<p>In this project we used a variety of technologies - IIIF, Storybook, Hypothes.is, Mediawiki, Omeka, Laravel, Vue.js - to create a new online digital edition of\nthe collected writings of Hayley, which will be hosted on the Fitzwilliam Museum’s website. Letters were transcribed via\na simple MicroPasts citizen science application</p>\n<p>We worked with <a href=\"https://phivk.com/\">Philo van Kemenade</a> and <a href=\"https://alexasteinbruck.com\">Alexa Steinbrück</a> to develop a Vue.js component framework for the front end.</p>\n<p>I wrote the laravel application that pulled these data together and presented a unified front end, with an integration\nfor SOLR based search and discovery in a couple of days.</p>\n<h3>William Hayley (1745-1820)</h3>\n<p>During his lifetime, Hayley was an influential author, scholar and champion of women’s writing.</p>\n<p>He was the first person to publish a substantial extract of Danté's Divine Comedy in English, declined the offer of the\npoet laureateship (partly for political reasons), and, in his biographical writings, often explored issues of mental health.</p>","id":"91c7009c-b97b-5d5b-a549-d4f0528b6586","timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":204},"frontmatter":{"date":"October 29, 2019","section":"projects","title":"Most Sacred
