Is it all just digging or is there a lot more to it? The Day of Archaeology project aims to provide a window into the daily lives of archaeologists from all over the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The project asks people working, studying or volunteering in the archaeological world to participate with us in a “Day of Archaeology” each year in the summer by recording their day and sharing it through text, images or video on this website.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The resulting Day of Archaeology project demonstrates the wide variety of work our profession undertakes day-to-day across the globe, and helps to raise public awareness of the relevance and importance of archaeology to the modern world. We want anyone with a personal, professional or voluntary interest in archaeology to get involved, and help highlight the reasons why archaeology is vital to protect the past and inform our futures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a paragraph, that was what the day of archaeology project was about. A collaborative blogging and social media experiment run for a number of years by a team of volunteers who are all professional archaeologists, and taking part in the project was completely free.</p>","id":"42c38550-2085-5759-96ad-8600256645f4","timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":198},"frontmatter":{"date":"October 29, 2019","section":"projects","title":"Day of Archaeology","description":"A project to create a website to promote the Day of Archaeology","role":null,"partners":["The British Museum","The Portable Antiquities Scheme","LP Archaeology","Council for British Archaeology","The Archaeology Data Service"],"collaborators":["Lorna Richardson","Matt Law","Jessica Ogden","Andrew Rheinhard","Kate Ellenberger","Andrew Dufton","Tom Goskar"],"institution":"The British Museum","publications":["Lorna-Jane Richardson, Matt Law, J Andrew Dufton, Kate Ellenberger, Stuart Eve, Tom Goskar, Jessica Ogden, Dan Pett, Andrew Reinhard (2018) Day of Archaeology 2011–2017: Global Community, Public Engagement, and Digital Practice in Internet Archaeology 47","Lorna-Jane Richardson, Matthew Law, Andrew Dufton, Kate Ellenberger, Stuart Eve, Tom Goskar, Jess Ogden, Daniel Pett, Andrew Reinhard, 2018.
