Is it all just digging or is there a lot more to it? The Day of Archaeology project aims to provide a window into the daily lives of archaeologists from all over the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The project asks people working, studying or volunteering in the archaeological world to participate with us in a “Day of Archaeology” each year in the summer by recording their day and sharing it through text, images or video on this website.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The resulting Day of Archaeology project demonstrates the wide variety of work our profession undertakes day-to-day across the globe, and helps to raise public awareness of the relevance and importance of archaeology to the modern world. We want anyone with a personal, professional or voluntary interest in archaeology to get involved, and help highlight the reasons why archaeology is vital to protect the past and inform our futures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a paragraph, that was what the day of archaeology project was about. A collaborative blogging and social media experiment run for a number of years by a team of volunteers who are all professional archaeologists, and taking part in the project was completely free.</p>","id":"037271d8-fb78-5c09-9fb3-2c894ba43cae","timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":198},"frontmatter":{"date":"October 29, 2019","section":"projects","title":"Day of Archaeology","description":"A project to create a website to promote the Day of Archaeology","role":null,"featuredImg":{"id":"50424d8e-1595-55a7-a032-9e3d6761c484","absolutePath":"/Users/danielpett/3D/GitHub/museologi.st/content/images/projects/dayofarch/5739627950_ef12967b93_o.jpg","publicURL":"/static/1a8c52bb8fe5c326e9ea80c2616e9a9e/5739627950_ef12967b93_o.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1a8c52bb8fe5c326e9ea80c2616e9a9e/04add/5739627950_ef12967b93_o.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1a8c52bb8fe5c326e9ea80c2616e9a9e/e07d1/5739627950_ef12967b93_o.jpg 150w,\n/static/1a8c52bb8fe5c326e9ea80c2616e9a9e/05177/5739627950_ef12967b93_o.jpg 300w,\n/static/1a8c52bb8fe5c326e9ea80c2616e9a9e/04add/5739627950_ef12967b93_o.jpg 600w,\n/static/1a8c52bb8fe5c326e9ea80c2616e9a9e/3d747/5739627950_ef12967b93_o.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/1a8c52bb8fe5c326e9ea80c2616e9a9e/628fd/5739627950_ef12967b93_o.webp 150w,\n/static/1a8c52bb8fe5c326e9ea80c2616e9a9e/8aaca/5739627950_ef12967b93_o.webp 300w,\n/static/1a8c52bb8fe5c326e9ea80c2616e9a9e/ec39e/5739627950_ef12967b93_o.webp 600w,\n/static/1a8c52bb8fe5c326e9ea80c2616e9a9e/49a25/5739627950_ef12967b93_o.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":600}}},"featuredImgAlt":null,"partners":["The British Museum","The Portable Antiquities Scheme","LP Archaeology","Council for British Archaeology","The Archaeology Data Service"],"collaborators":["Lorna Richardson","Matt Law","Jessica Ogden","Andrew Rheinhard","Kate Ellenberger","Andrew Dufton","Tom Goskar"],"institution":"The British Museum","publications":["Lorna-Jane Richardson, Matt Law, J Andrew Dufton, Kate Ellenberger, Stuart Eve, Tom Goskar, Jessica Ogden, Dan Pett, Andrew Reinhard (2018) Day of Archaeology 2011–2017: Global Community, Public Engagement, and Digital Practice in Internet Archaeology 47","Lorna-Jane Richardson, Matthew Law, Andrew Dufton, Kate Ellenberger, Stuart Eve, Tom Goskar, Jess Ogden, Daniel Pett, Andrew Reinhard, 2018.
