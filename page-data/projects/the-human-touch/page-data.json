Simple video embeds were used for the head of each page, the website\ndid the job...</p>\n<h2>Animations</h2>\n<p>To accompany the exhibition, we produced a series of animations with the curators and the artists, with\nNick Harris (former BM colleague), leading the development of these guiding my colleagues through the process.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n        <div class=\"ratio-16x9 ratio my-3\">\n            <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y52LprXN6_c\" title=\"YouTube video player\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n        <div class=\"ratio-16x9 ratio my-3\">\n            <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cgtrc4Cxu2w\" title=\"YouTube video player\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>  ","id":"5d8ec595-4d02-5f0b-b27a-a7899a1dd870","timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":169},"frontmatter":{"date":"October 29, 2019","section":"projects","title":"Human Touch digital element","description":"A digital element for the Human Touch exhibition","role":"Developer","partners":null,"collaborators":["Elenor Ling","Ayomi Oni","Suzanne Reynolds"],"institution":"The Fitzwilliam Museum","publications":null,"geo_lat":52.199722,"geo_lon":0.119167,"news":null,"background":{"id":"0b8f869b-6070-59b9-a875-50afab8706fb","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/museologi.st/museologi.st/content/images/2021/tht_202012_03_mfj22_mas-1-.jpg","publicURL":"/static/929414c580620c9950ade310b57dd975/tht_202012_03_mfj22_mas-1-.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/929414c580620c9950ade310b57dd975/b4731/tht_202012_03_mfj22_mas-1-.jpg","srcSet":"/static/929414c580620c9950ade310b57dd975/634ff/tht_202012_03_mfj22_mas-1-.jpg 300w,\n/static/929414c580620c9950ade310b57dd975/44264/tht_202012_03_mfj22_mas-1-.jpg 600w,\n/static/929414c580620c9950ade310b57dd975/b4731/tht_202012_03_mfj22_mas-1-.jpg 1200w,\n/static/929414c580620c9950ade310b57dd975/e749e/tht_202012_03_mfj22_mas-1-.jpg 2400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/929414c580620c9950ade310b57dd975/d863a/tht_202012_03_mfj22_mas-1-.webp 300w,\n/static/929414c580620c9950ade310b57dd975/3879c/tht_202012_03_mfj22_mas-1-.webp 600w,\n/static/929414c580620c9950ade310b57dd975/0429b/tht_202012_03_mfj22_mas-1-.webp 1200w,\n/static/929414c580620c9950ade310b57dd975/bd01e/tht_202012_03_mfj22_mas-1-.webp 2400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":600}}},"project_website":"https://human-touch.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/","slug":"/projects/the-human-touch/","vimeo":null,"zenodo_doi":null,"github_repo":[{"url":"https://github.com/FitzwilliamMuseum/the-human-touch","name":"The Human Touch website code"}],"type":null,"grant_number":null,"grant_amount":null,"funders":null,"tags":["museums","Creative Economy","gatsby","react","graphql","directus"],"deposited_archive":null,"documents":null,"audio":null,"featuredImg":{"id":"e657dc2a-2250-54dc-9512-9671510487e8","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/museologi.st/museologi.st/content/images/2021/706_201306_adn21_dc2.jpg","publicURL":"/static/512254e8885250f0dd680666c240b4ec/706_201306_adn21_dc2.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/512254e8885250f0dd680666c240b4ec/279d1/706_201306_adn21_dc2.jpg","srcSet":"/static/512254e8885250f0dd680666c240b4ec/a793a/706_201306_adn21_dc2.jpg 100w,\n/static/512254e8885250f0dd680666c240b4ec/e56ef/706_201306_adn21_dc2.jpg 200w,\n/static/512254e8885250f0dd680666c240b4ec/279d1/706_201306_adn21_dc2.jpg 400w,\n/static/512254e8885250f0dd680666c240b4ec/a45ee/706_201306_adn21_dc2.jpg 800w","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/512254e8885250f0dd680666c240b4ec/17f38/706_201306_adn21_dc2.webp 100w,\n/static/512254e8885250f0dd680666c240b4ec/1070e/706_201306_adn21_dc2.webp 200w,\n/static/512254e8885250f0dd680666c240b4ec/3398c/706_201306_adn21_dc2.webp 400w,\n/static/512254e8885250f0dd680666c240b4ec/afc30/706_201306_adn21_dc2.webp 800w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"}]},"width":400,"height":400}}},"images":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/projects/the-human-touch/","id":"5d8ec595-4d02-5f0b-b27a-a7899a1dd870","breadcrumb":{"location":"/projects/the-human-touch/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/projects","crumbLabel":"projects"},{"pathname":"/projects/the-human-touch","crumbLabel":"the-human-touch"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2240598579","2679611508","3600676621"],"slicesMap":{}}
