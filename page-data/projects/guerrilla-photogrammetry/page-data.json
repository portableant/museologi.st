After I made that, my model making started to become\na formal part of my work, and I transferred that aspect to the Fitzwilliam Museum.</p>\n<h2>Guerrilla model making</h2>\n<p>My first real outing in another institution, was with Tom Flynn (now of Sketchfab), who worked with me\nat the British Museum. We both went to the Museums and the Web Conference in 2017, held in Cleveland.\nWe heard a talk by Jane Alexander about all the things that the Cleveland Museum of Art had been doing and how\n3D work was a barrier due to complexity. We took an outing to the CMA and scanned about 12 objects and processed\nthem overnight before our presentation the next day.</p>\n<div class=\"ratio-16x9 ratio my-3\">\n<iframe

have created scans of all the Assyrian reliefs on public display in the British Museum and large amounts of the\nParthenon marbles.</p>\n<h2>Museums scanned in</h2>\n<p>I have so far made scans

others to reuse, currently I have an open folder on Google Drive and\nalso deposit photo sets on Github and Zenodo and issue DOIs for the
