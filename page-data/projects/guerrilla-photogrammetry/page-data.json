We both went to the Museums and the Web Conference in 2017, held in Cleveland.\nWe heard a talk by Jane Alexander about all the things that the Cleveland Museum of Art had been doing and how\n3D work was a barrier due to complexity. We took an outing to the CMA and scanned about 12 objects and processed\nthem overnight before our presentation the next day.</p>\n<div class=\"ratio-16x9 ratio my-3\">\n<iframe src=\"https://sketchfab.com/playlists/embed?collection=ce9a3d1cbd23460e9ad9390aa5b9972e&autostart=0\"\n        title=\"Cleveland Museum of Art\"\n        allowfullscreen\n        mozallowfullscreen=\"true\"\n        webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"\n        allow=\"autoplay;
