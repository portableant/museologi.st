As with most digital things at the Fitzwilliam, the digital elements for the Human Touch were 
sprung on the team shortly before opening (the museum's planning forms had not specified any digital 
elements for this display.) This was no reflection on the curators of the exhibition, Elenor Ling and Suzanne 
Reynolds were excellent in helping to produce the content. 

For this project, I decided to develop the web platform using Gatsby (mainly to
learn something new) and our main content management system, Directus 8 and the old Gatsby npm packages. 
Data was collated and uploaded to the system by Elenor Ling, myself and our British Museum Futures placement Ayomi Oni, and 
from there the labels and information were collated. Simple video embeds were used for the head of each page, the website 
did the job...

## Animations

To accompany the exhibition, we produced a series of animations with the curators and the artists, with 
Nick Harris (former BM colleague), leading the development of these guiding my colleagues through the process.
