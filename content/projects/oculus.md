The Oculus project was a small project that brought together several technologies 
to deliver a semi-VR experience built using React which could be viewed across devices and platforms
and as an embedded product on Facebook. Several galleries (Gallery 4 - Egypt and Gallery 61 - Nebamun paintings) were photographed using 360 imaging and panoramas were stitched 
together and then meshed with several 3d models that I created and [optimised](https://github.com/BritishMuseum/DH-OculusVR-models)
for web delivery and augmented with sound and text snippets to enable the user to learn more about the project.
