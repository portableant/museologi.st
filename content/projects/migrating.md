Upon joining the Fitzwilliam Museum, I realised how much digital legacy I had inherited as head of department. 
Over 100 websites of various complexity, built on various out of date systems such as Drupal 7, old PHP code, static 
HTML pages, and all came with their own quirks and issues. Many had substantial amounts of content, were often broken with links 
that had rotted over time, had missing includes or had not been migrated properly. A ticking preservation time bomb.

## What did I do? 

To deal with this legacy, I decided to take a step-by-step approach and migrate what could easily be salvaged and
to ignore the Flash based websites - rich though they might be! My plan was to:

* Incorporate structured pages into the main Fitzwilliam website Directus CMS
* Build stand alone Jekyll sites for rich content pages (template available within Fitz GitHub)
  * Submit sites to the Internet Archive
  * Submit code to Zenodo and issue a DOI when relevant
  * Create a data.json file and then index this so that content appeared in our SOLR 8.11 index and make the pages findable
* Fix all missing content and broken links (often by leaching content from the Wayback machine)

This took masses of time to achieve, and by the time I left, I hadn't even got to half way. The table
below shows the progress I made, links to the new URL, GitHub repos and type of resource
