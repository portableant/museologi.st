Towards the end of my time working at the Museum, a small database project came up for one of 
the Keepers of museum collections - Vicky Avery. She had been awarded funding to develop a database of 
sculptures representing Black people in museum collections in the United Kingdom. To enable this, I 
implemented:

* an Omeka S project website (only internal usage until research reaches critical mass), which 
enabled data collection
* IIIF images
* a logical CIDOC CRM mapped schema
* links to people and other entities
* mapping of objects to their current locations.

There's not much I can say about this project, as the content was in development when I left. Once the Omeka S database was 
assembled, the plan was to use the API in the same way as we did for the [Hayley Papers project](https://amor.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk) and
build a front end with some great UX and UI work.

It could end up being a very crucial piece of scholarship.
