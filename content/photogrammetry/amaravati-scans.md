This collection of scans was created for a collaboration with Soluis Heritage in 2017, when 
they created an interactive reconstruction of the temple of Amaravati. These scans were meant to 
have been created with an Artec structured light machine, but Amelia, our placement PhD student
couldn't climb the ladder to capture the scans. 

So, instead, I climbed the ladders and used photogrammetry to scan the large pieces and to rapidly scan the 
smaller pieces.

### A video of the reconstruction

Soluis Heritage (Steve Colmer and team), have created a video of the reconstruction of the temple of Amaravati.
This is looped at the west end of the Hotung gallery and can be seen on Vimeo.
