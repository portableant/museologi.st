These scans of the Yaxchilan Lintels are from the British Museum Mexico gallery and were 
shot as a visitor to the museum and are simple photogrammetric models processed in 
Agisoft Photoscan/Metashape and Reality Capture. 

They are super simple to capture, just a selection of DSLR and mobile phone images taken in gallery 
under visiting conditions walking past the objects on display. Careful, don't set the alarms off!
