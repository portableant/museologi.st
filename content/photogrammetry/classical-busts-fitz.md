This collection of 3D scans was created from the Fitzwilliam Museum's Classical Archaeology collection and 
was generated for integration within the Museum's revamped website, for use in 
the AHRC funded CEEF3D and Linking Islands of Data projects. Methodology varied 
for these - photogrammetry for many, Artec Leo scanned for others.
