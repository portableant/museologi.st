A collection of scans of the casts of the wonderful classical Archaeology building. Most of these were made during short 
periods of time visiting their curator Susanne Turner to chat. The objects in this 
museum are relatively simple to scan, just walk around with a DSLR or mobile phone and 
grab pictures of their casts.
