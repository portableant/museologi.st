This scan of ancient human remains was produced for Sally Fletcher, to complement
the CT scans she had produced for a room 3 exhibition that focused on the skull. I scanned 
this with Jennifer Wexler, just using a DSLR and mobile phone and processed it in 
Agisoft overnight.

A plastered human skull; the skull was taken as the base and the features of the face were modelled on it in plaster. 
One eye is made from a bivalve shell divided in two. The other has one, smaller, complete shell in place and is missing its twin.

Culture/period: Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (8500 BC- 6000BC)
