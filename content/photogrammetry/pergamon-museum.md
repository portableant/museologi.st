This collection of 3D scans was created whilst on holiday in Berlin and are from two of the Pergamon Museum venues.
Most of these were created from photogrammetry using an iphone 13, moving rapidly. The first 3d model in this set is created
from a video. Some of these models are on display in the das Panorama exhibition space, the others are now not on display 
for many years as they are hidden away during the long term rebuilding of the Pergamon Museum.
