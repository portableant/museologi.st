My mother recently changed hard ware and a spare imac 2013 was up for grabs, trouble
was no one could remember the password to get in. No problem!

To reset on OSX do the following:

1. Restart the computer
2. Hold down the Command and R keys until you see the Apple logo
3. Select Utilities > Terminal from recovery tools
4. Type the following command and press enter:
   `resetpassword`
5. Follow the instructions on screen
6. Restart the computer

You should now be able to log in with the new password.
