Today was my last day at the Fitzwilliam Museum after nearly 4.5 years of turbulent times. The Museum 
has gone through a belated period of organisational change, and I left as part of this process. I 
returned all my equipment, keys and cards, and left the building for the last time having seen just a couple of people; I don't think I will ever 
set foot in there ever again. A shame as I grew up visiting there with my parents regularly and it 
was part of the circle of influence that led to me working in museums and heritage. 

During my time there, I lost my father, we had long periods of family illness to contend with, the pandemic
destroyed working practices and I had a team that managed to keep the Museum communicating whilst we were all confined 
to our homes. I rejoined my college, St Edmund's, as a Senior Member, and I became chairman of Cambridge University Rugby Football Union and joined a
wide array of committees and steering groups, and I was appointed to the AHRC Peer Review College. 

I managed to bring in Â£1/2 million pounds of research funding as principal or co-investigator, from the AHRC, Leverhulme, British Academy,
Marlay Research Trust, GCRF, and Cambridge University internal competitive funding pools. The highlights were when I worked with a fabulous group 
of post-doctoral fellows and travelling to Egypt twice with my brilliant Antiquities colleagues.
I've documented my projects and research from my time at the Museum on my [projects page](/projects).

I won't miss the 5 hour round trip in my car and I won't miss the endless meetings that begot yet more meetings.
I never really felt at home in the Fitzwilliam.
